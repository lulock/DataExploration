##Let's Begin 
###### *What is Apache Spark?*
A big data processing engine.

###### *What are the benefits of Spark?*
- easy to use
- fast
- a general engine

###### *What are the main features?*
- running computations __in memory__
- offers simple APIs in Python, Java, Scala and SQL
- can run in Hadoop clusters
- can combine different processing models 
    - _e.g. ML data classification **in real-time** of streaming input data!_ 
    - _querying results, also **in real-time**!

###### *What were the motivations?*
- Hadoop MapReduce was observed to be inefficient for iterative and interactive computation
